# UnrealModUnlocker-Public 0.26.5
Unlocks loading of Third Party Unreal Engine 4 loose files for 75-90% of UE4 games.
This software is for unlocking loading of loose file packages (.uasset | .ubulk | .uexp | .umap and any other file you could normally find inside the PAK archives).
Any file already in a PAK archive has a virtual path. (You can find filetype and filepath with UMODEL or FMODEL)
Recreate the same filetype and filepath in an Unreal Engine 4 project.
Cook files in UE4.
Copy the "modded" file with the proper file path structure into the correct place in the game folders.
Make sure to have the UnrealModUnlocker installed in the Game/ProjectName/Binaries/Win64/ folder.
Run game!
Done!
